To create a virtual environment in Python3 and activate it immediately use this command in your terminal:

mkvirtualenv name_of_your_env

To deactivate the environment use the deactivate command.

To list all available virtual environments use the command workon or lsvirtualenv (lsvirtualenv will show the same result as workon but in a fancier way) in your terminal:

workon

lsvirtualenv

To activate one specific environment use workon + name of your environment:

workon name_of_your_env

There are several useful command you might need to use someday:

Rmvirtualenv will remove a specific virtual environment located in your .virtualenv directory.

rmvirtualenv name_of_your_env

Cpvirtualenv will copy the existing virtual environment to a new virtual environment and activate it.

cpvirtualenv old_virtual_env new_virtual_env
